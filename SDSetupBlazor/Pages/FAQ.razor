		How do you determine the version numbers displayed on the website?
	</div>
	<div class="content @(active[7] == true ? "active" : "")">
		<p>Here is how versions are determined and presented:<ul><li>If the version is a full release, the version from the release title is used. If there is no version specified, the version from the release tag is used.</li><li>If the release is a specific commit, the commit is specified with c.xxxxxxxx where xxxxxxxx is the first 8 characters of the commit hash.</li><li>If none of the above can be determined, the date the package was retrieved is used (YYYY.MM.DD). Reasons this may be done include:</li><ul><li>The release tag is not helpful (something strange that doesn't really specify a version. This is rare).</li><li>An included package differs enough from a build or release that using a commit hash or release version would be misleading (for example, our copy of Atmosphere uses an entirely different bootloader than the one built from the repo).</li><li>The build was retrieved from a (trusted) third party.</li></ul></ul></p>

		Are packages updated automatically?
	</div>
	<div class="content @(active[8] == true ? "active" : "")">
		<p>Packages are updated and tested manually because:<ul><li>Commits pushed directly to repos may not be ready for general use and therefore should be tested (and full releases should be prioritized).</li><li>File directories and structures of released archives or builds might change so it is unsafe to assume they can be automatically added the same way as a previous release.</li></ul></p>
